The format for questions used in this project must be of the form:

Question
Option 0
Option 1
Option 2
Option 3
Correct option (zero-indexed)


where the question and the four options are strings, and the correct option is an integer. This will allow the program to smoothly detect whether or not a given selection is correct.


Note: ALL questions in this folder must be multiple-choice and have four options. If the question is true or false, make sure you add some "filler/weird" options to ensure the number of options is still 4. For example:

The 50th IMO was held in Germany. True or False?
True
False
What's the IMO?
I don't know
0

Note that the 4th and 5th lines are clearly incorrect, but it is necessary for those options to be included.

In addition, make certain that the options are short enough in length to fit on one line, as the radio buttons are not spaced very far apart vertically, which does not allow for multiline text.

In multiplayer/two-player mode, you will have to compete with your opponent to get as many questions correct as possible. One of you will answer with the ASDF keys, while the other will answer with the number keys. In the event of a wrong answer, no points will be deducted, but you will lose your chance to guess for that round. Climb the leaderboard by getting more wins. Good luck!
